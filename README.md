## Peach Concept

Read about the [Peach concept](https://github.com/PeachProject/PeachStandalone)!

## What is PeachShared?

As you can read in the Peach concept, Peach is a distributed system.
All Peach modules were not created equal but they all have common functionality.
To bundle this functionality and avoid duplicated code and versioning errors this shared python library was created.
Most other Peach Gits will contain this git as a submodule.

## What am I doing here?

I don't know how you got here but maybe you are interested in cloning the [PeachStandalone Git](https://github.com/PeachProject/PeachStandalone).
